    "\n",
    "#### 1. Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in my model involves a pre-processing stage. I decided to augment the training data with jittered data as described in Pierre Sermanet and Yann LeCun's [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). In this paper pre-processing involved randomly adding transfromed versions of the original traning set to form a jittered dat set. The transforms they employed inclded randomly pertrubing in position ([-2,2] pixels), rotation ([-15,+15] degrees), and scale ([0.9,1.1] ratio). In my pre-processing stage images were randomly pertrubed in position ([-2,2] pixels), rotation ([-15,+15] degrees), brightness ([1.0, 2.5] gamma correction), and gaussian blur (5x5 kernal). Below is an example of each transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][transformations]\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested two data augmentation approaches. First, I tested randomly augmenting images from each class until there were at least 1500 samples for each class. This resulted in a more balanced data set. A bar chart with the result of this augmentation is below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][augment2]\n",
    "\n",
    "My second augmentation approach involved addiding 4 augmented versions of each image to the training set. The data set is still unbalanced however, there are now a suitable number of samples for the under represented classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][augment]\n",
    "\n",
    "In my testing I found adding 4 augmented versions of each image in pre-processing led to more accurate results than  my approach to balance the data set. After augmentation I now had 173,995 training imgages (up from 34,799)\n",
    "\n",
    "After augmenting the data set each image was converted to grayscale. Sermanet and LeCun achieved very high accuracy (98.97%) primarily using the grayscale component of each image. I focused on using the grayscale version of each image in my model to reduce processing and computation time. Below is an example of a grayscale image. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I normalized the image data. Pixel data was scaled from [0, 255] to [-1, 1] using the formula: (pixel - 128)/ 128 as suggested in class. This is a good approximation for image normalization.\n",
    "\n",

    " \n",
    "My model uses two convolutional layers which incorporate max pooling and relu activation. The convolutions use a 5x5 filter size. This is the same filter size used in the LeNet architecture which was the starting point for my network testing. After convolution a 2x2 max pooling is performed. Pooling makes the convolution more robust against image noise and decreases the amount of computation necessary. Finally a relu activation function is applied to introduce non-linearities. This is repeated in the second convolution layer. After the convolution layers come three fully conneted layers. The fully connected layers reduce the size from 800 to 400, 400 to 200, and finally 200 to 43. Dropout was pefromed afted the first two fully connected layers to prevent against overfitting, using a keep probability of 35%. The outputs of the network are our logits. The logits are then fed to the function tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits() to convert to a one-hot encoding scheme. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Training Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "For my model I used a learning rate of 0.0001, a batch size of 128, and 100 epochs. As in the LeNet architecture, the Adam optimizer was used. These numbers were chosen largely by trial and error. Initial network weights were populated usnig a truncated normal distribution with hyper parameters mu = 0 and sigma = 0.1. In addition dropout was employed after the first two fully connected layers with a keep probability of 35%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by using the LeNet implementation as was recommended in class. In my first attempts I used RGB images. After reading Sermanet and LeCun's Traffisc Sign Classifier paper I switched to grayscale images. Without tweaking the LeNet architecture I was unable to get validation accuracy over 90%. Next I started to modify the architecture, specifically the convolutional layers (filter size, pooling size, number of conv layers, etc), but still failed to increase accuracy above 90%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next I decided to employ data augmentation. At this point I was still running on my CPU. Given how long pre-processing and training were now taking, I decided to switch over to a GPU. Specifically I started using a g2.2xlarge instance on Amazon Web Services as recommended in calss. My biggest regret with this project is that I did not switch to  AWS sooner, as the processing speed was significantly improved! After adding augmentation I was able to increase accuracy over 93% for the first time. This highlighted for me just how important augmentation can be. Next I started to compare training set accuracy against validation set accuracy. At this stage my training accuracy was much higher than my validation accuracy, a sign that my model was overfitting. I decided to implement dropout to help prevent this. I tried implenting dropout in various sections of the network (after both convolutional and fully connected layers) as was described in Srivastava, Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Salakhutdinov's [dropout paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf). I did not see improvement with dropout after the convolutional layers so I finally settled on dropout after the first two fully connected layers with a keep probabiltity of 35%. \n",
    "\n",
    "I aslo tried feeding the output of first convolutional layer to the first fully connected layer, as described by Sermanet and LeCun, but did not see improvements with this method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 100%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 98.4%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 97.2%\n",
